# CivCardGame — TODO / Idea Backlog

> A scratch list for ideas caught **in passing** so they aren't lost — *not* a
> committed plan. Anything here is a candidate, not a promise. Decided, designed
> work lives in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md); this is the inbox that feeds it.

**How we use it:** say *"jot: …"* or *"TODO: …"* (or "note that down") mid-task and
the idea lands here as a one-liner without derailing what we're doing. We triage
later — promote items into `DESIGN.md` / real work, or drop them.

> Tags (optional): `[size: S/M/L]` rough effort · `[?]` needs design discussion ·
> `[blocked]` waiting on something else · `[phase: N]` roadmap phase (1 = run loop · 2 = contract + meta shell · 3 = economy & progression · 4 = content & balance).

## Phase 3 — planned steps (economy & progression)

> The Phase 3 design is locked in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) (*Economy & progression*); this is
> the actionable cut, held here for later sessions. Suggested order: 1 → 2 & 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9
> (Steps 0, 1, 2, and 3 are **done**). **Steps 1+2+3+4 form a playable spine** — unlock cards from
> missions, own copies, build capped decks — before the map/shop UI (Step 5) lands.
> Pre-alpha: **no save migration**, replace the store shape freely.

- **Step 1 — Ownership & currency core** ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below. `[phase: 3]`
- **Step 2 — Deck-editor copy caps** ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below. `[phase: 3]`

  - **Step 5.1 — Campaign Map screen** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below. `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 5.2 — Shop** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below. `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 5.3 — Mission detail panel** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below. `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Step 6 — Infinite missions** — endless, replayable missions that never win and pay
  Influence = rounds survived. Cut into substeps; suggested order **6.1 → 6.2 → 6.3a → 6.3b → 6.3c**.
  `[phase: 3]`

    *Done / shipped* below. `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 6.3c — Creeping Decay infinite mission** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below.
    `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Step 7 — Card stickers** *(last, deepest)* — permanent per-copy card buffs bought with Influence
  (DESIGN.md *Economy & progression*: "a card sticker buffs a *single owned copy* forever"). **Design
  settled in discussion (2026-07-07):** model the meta collection as **uniform card instances** — every
  owned copy is an identified `CardInstance` and decks reference copies by instance id — rather than
  lazily minting identity only when a sticker is applied. Rationale: with uniform instances, stickering
  is a pure *in-place mutation of one instance that touches nothing else* — no bare-count→instance
  conversion, so no deck reconciliation and no way to duplicate a copy by forgetting a branch (the trap
  the first attempt hit: the deck already held both farms, was unaware of the sticker, and a stickered
  3rd farm slipped past the 2-copy cap). Every deck referencing that instance sees the sticker for free
  (single source of truth); the "which of my two farms gets it, the decked one or the shelf one?"
  ambiguity is resolved by an explicit per-instance pick (7.3) over stable, ordered identities (7.4).
  The run boundary still deep-copies each meta instance into a fresh run `CardInstance` (run `counters`
  mutate and must never persist back). The precursor is already **done** (Stage 4 of the resolver
  rewrite): pile cards are `CardInstance`s with per-copy state (`counters`). Suggested order 7.1 → 7.9
  (7.7/7.8/7.9 added 2026-07-07, after 7.6 shipped — polish/expansion, not required for the core loop).
  `[size: L]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.1 — Bounded copy tiers (drop `'unlimited'`)** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below.
    `[size: S]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.2 — Uniform meta card instances** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below.
    `[size: L]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.3 — Collection per-instance view** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below.
    `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.4 — Ordered deck assignment** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below.
    `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.5 — Card stickers in the meta (not yet in the run)** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped*
    below. `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.6 — Card stickers in the run loop** — ✅ done — see *Done / shipped* below.
    `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.7 — Raise the sticker cap to 2 per instance** — `MetaCardInstance.stickers` is capped at
    one (Step 7.5's "v1 choice, easily relaxed later" — now the thing to relax). Touches
    `rules/collection.ts`'s `hasSticker` (an instance stops being fungible once it has *two*, not one)
    and `rules/stickers.ts`'s `buySticker` (append to `stickers` rather than replace, reject once
    already at 2); `CardInstancePanel`'s attach UI needs to let a once-stickered instance take a
    second sticker instead of disabling outright. `rules/stickers.ts`'s `effectiveGain`/`effectiveCost`
    already iterate by sticker id, so a second sticker composing (e.g. Reinforced + Efficient on the
    same copy) should fall out for free — worth a test once it lands. `[size: S]` `[phase: 3]`
  - **Step 7.8 — Add Irrigation sticker** — unlike Reinforced's blanket "+1 to whatever this copy
    produces," Irrigation only attaches to (and only bumps) a **food-producing building**: +1 food
    production, no effect on anything else. Needs a card-aware check before applying (does this
    card's `produces` include `food`?), not just a self-stickers lookup like `effectiveGain` does
    today — the first sticker whose eligibility depends on the card, not just the copy. Open design
    question for whoever picks this up: does the shop/attach UI hide Irrigation entirely on an
    ineligible card, or offer it and have it silently do nothing? `[size: S]` `[phase: 3]` `[?]`
  - **Step 7.9 — Sticker UI: per-sticker icons, bottom-left badge, effective values everywhere** —
    four related gaps left after 7.5/7.6:
    1. **Distinct icons** — `CardFace`'s `stickerBadge` is one hardcoded 🏷️ regardless of which
       sticker is attached; each `content/stickers.ts` entry should carry its own icon glyph, shown
       instead of the generic tag.
    2. **Bottom-left placement** — today the badge sits in the opposite corner from the ×N count
       badge (top-right); move it to a fixed bottom-left slot of its own instead of sharing/opposing
       the count badge's corner.
    3. **Meta screens show effective values too** — Step 7.6's `effectiveCard` fixed the *run loop*
       (hand/tableau/workZone/pile-viewer/zoom all show a stickered copy's true cost/output), but
       `Collection.tsx`, `Shop.tsx`, and `CardInstancePanel.tsx` still render the raw `CARDS[cardId]`
       — they need the same `effectiveCard` treatment so a stickered copy's real numbers show before
       it's ever taken into a run, not just after.
    4. **Loop cards stay visibly stickered** — Step 7.6 made a stickered card's *numbers* correct in
       the run, but never passes `stickerBadge` through any of `Board.tsx`'s CardFace renders, so a
       stickered copy in hand/tableau looks identical to a plain one except for its stats. Wire
       `stickerBadge` through the run loop's renders too (same `!!self.stickers?.length` check
       `effectiveCard` already uses), so a stickered copy reads as visibly special in the run, not
       only in the meta. `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Step 8 — Board stickers** — permanent board modifiers bought with Influence (DESIGN.md: board
  stickers *are* the "board modifiers" — one concept, not two). The *easy* half of stickers: a board
  isn't multi-copy, so a board sticker just lives on the board entry in the meta and `setup.ts` layers it
  onto the run's starting resource profile (like a mission's `setup` modifiers) — no per-instance identity
  question, so entirely independent of Step 7's collection rework. Whether several stack on one board is a
  deferred balance detail (DESIGN.md open question). `[size: M]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Step 9 — Tutorial missions** — the first few meta missions double as tutorials,
  introducing mechanics progressively; tutorial entry-node missions on the map. Covers
  designing several missions, onboarding indicators/popups, and careful pacing so new
  mechanics aren't dumped on the player all at once. Rough pacing: the starting deck holds
  only `work`/`action` cards, no buildings — mission 1 unlocks the first buildings (House,
  Farm, Workshop); mission 2 introduces territory limitation (and maybe conquest?) alongside
  them. Goal is to reach a certain population. Unlocks culture stuff. Mission 3 explains culture, goal to reach culture lvl2. `[size: L]` `[?]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Step 10 — Peripheral** — `Stats` rework once rewards/trends exist.
  Independent. `[phase: 3]`

## Meta loop (`src/meta/`)

- **End-of-Phase-3 cleanup: simplify save parsing, not remove it** — `meta/store.ts`'s `SCHEMA_VERSION`/`exportSave`/`importSave` plumbing stays (still the real save/load-file mechanism); what should go is `parsePlayerStore`'s per-field *leniency* (the decks-missing fallback, the field-by-field shape checks written to tolerate a store that predates some Phase 3 field). Once Phase 3 ships, assume every save in the world is already Phase-3-shaped — pre-alpha players are told to clear their save regularly — so `parsePlayerStore` can go back to a plain "does this parse as a `PlayerStore`" check instead of carrying per-field pre-Phase-3 fallbacks. `[phase: 3]`
- **Card modifiers** — attach persistent modifiers to individual cards → **decided as stickers**; see **Step 7** above. `[phase: 3]`
- **Fuse Shop into Collection (and the future board menu)** — `Shop.tsx` and `Collection.tsx` are largely
  redundant today: both list the same owned cards grouped the same way. Instead of a separate nav tab,
  clicking a card in Collection should open its per-instance panel already able to do everything Shop
  does for that cardId — buy the next copy tier, attach a sticker to a chosen instance — rather than
  bouncing to a different screen. Same idea applies to boards once **Step 8**'s board stickers land (a
  future board menu should let you buy/attach a board's modifiers in place, not a separate board-shop
  screen). Also add a visual hint on a card's Collection tile/group when it has an available upgrade
  (a tier buy or an unstickered instance) so the player doesn't have to open every card to find out.
  `[?]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Stats screen UI rework** — `Stats.tsx` is currently a plain list of run-result rows (shell-only, shipped with Phase 2 step 6); revisit its look once there's more to show (rewards, trends across runs) → **Step 10** above. `[?]` `[phase: 3]`

## Cards & content (`src/content/`)

- **Remove Settlers, replace with a Hut building** `[?]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Disasters — expand** — the `event` card mechanic shipped (see `CHANGELOG.md`); grow it out with more disaster types beyond the Barbarian and missions that inject them (details TBD) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- New mission type: "Metropolis" `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- New mission: "Build the Wonder" `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Culture-based missions (depend on the Culture resource) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Building that changes hand size (e.g. +1 card drawn per round) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Resources transformation? Like a building that transforms production into science for example `[phase: 4]`
- **Age tag on cards** — tag each card with the age it unlocks in, so the player can sort/filter by age `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Foresight corner case: empty draw pile silently wastes the card** — `content/cards.ts`'s Foresight resolver does `G.deck.slice(0, 3)` and bails on `length === 0` without reshuffling, so playing it with an empty deck (but a full discard) pays its 1🌾science, files to discard, and does *nothing* — no peek, no feedback — contradicting its own "Peek the top 3" text. `unplayableReason` (`rules/playability.ts`) has no draw-pile gate, so nothing stops the play. Fix depends on the eager-reshuffle item above (once `G.deck` is empty only when the discard is too, Foresight's `slice` sees the real pile); then **also handle the deck-AND-discard-both-empty case** — either gate the card as unplayable then (add an `UnplayableReason` kind, mirroring `noBuildingsToDestroy`) so it can't be wasted, or let it peek/draw fewer than 3 gracefully. Decide which; a hard gate matches the existing "don't let a play fizzle for nothing" precedent. `[size: S]` `[phase: 3]`

## UI (`src/components/`)

- **Multi-pip staffing UI** — once a building can require 2–3 workers, its box needs one pip per worker slot (not the current single staff-toggle icon), so partial staffing is visible and each pip can be dragged independently. Follow-up to the now-shipped building→building worker drag; blocked on a multi-worker building actually existing (see [[multi-worker-buildings-roadmap]]). `[size: M] [?] [blocked]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Bulk-move modifier for worker transfers** — a modifier (e.g. shift-drag) to move N workers from one building to another in one gesture, instead of one pip-drag per worker. Only pays off once multi-pip staffing (above) exists. `[size: S] [?] [blocked]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Stable card ordering across views** — cards currently "move around" when adding/removing in the deck editor (and potentially other card grids); pick a sensible, stable sort order (by kind? cost? catalogue order?) and apply it consistently everywhere cards are listed — collection, deck editor picker/banner, pile viewers. `[size: S] [?] `
- **Bug: white flash between mission lore panel and board/deck popup** — Step 5.3's `MissionDetailPanel` → `LaunchPopup` handoff on "Continue" shows a brief white flash, likely the backdrop unmounting/remounting between the two modals rather than one panel morphing into the next. `[size: S]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Barbarian Tide's lore should show the Barbarian card** — `MissionDetailPanel` (Step 5.3) only shows the mission's *reward* card face; Barbarian Tide's lore column should also preview the Barbarian event card itself, since that's the card the mission is actually about. Also applies to threat cards in Long Winter and Long Decline `[size: S]` `[?]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Mission Lore cards should be click-to-zoom** — any `CardFace` shown in `MissionDetailPanel` (the reward unlock, and the Barbarian preview above) should open the shared `CardZoomOverlay` on click, same as hand/pile-viewer/Collection cards. `[size: S]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Bug: worker-drag start looks disabled when no idle population is free** — dragging a worker off a building/Work box onto another building's staffing area, when there's no idle population available to complete the move, shows the OS "unavailable" cursor because the staff-toggle `<button>` is `disabled`. That reads as "you can't drag this" rather than "there's nowhere for it to go yet," which will confuse the player. `[size: S]` `[?]`
- **`CardZoomOverlay`'s hint text is misleading for non-playable cards** — the one hint string ("Drag a card onto the board to play · click anywhere to close", `Board.tsx`) is shared by every zoom (hand, tableau, discard/removed piles, and now threats), so it wrongly implies a tableau building, a discarded card, or a threat card can be dragged onto the board to play. Noticed while verifying Step 6.3b's threat-zone click-to-zoom. `[size: S]` `[?]`

## Game design & balance

- Card that gives a draw when expanding territory `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Card effects that trigger on discard / on draw, to enable combos `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Minimum deck size — 20 cards** — enforce a floor on deck size (mirrors the existing
  `MAX_DECKS` cap precedent — a core rule enforced at the deck writer, not just a UI gate);
  also means adjusting `content/decks.ts`'s starter deck up to 20 cards to satisfy it.
  `[phase: 3]`
- **Default hand limit — 4 instead of 5** — lower the base starting hand size from 5 to 4.
  `[phase: 3]`

## Tech debt / architecture

- **Event-bus / trigger layer for card effects** — Today a card's `resolve`/`produce`
  closure can only fire at a **fixed, small set of engine-owned trigger points**: on-play
  (`run/moves.ts` `playCard`→`resolveCard`), per-round production for *operating*
  tableau/workZone instances (`applyUpkeep`→`rules/production.ts`→`resolveProduction`),
  per-round threat tick (`applyUpkeep`→`rules/threats.ts` `tickThreats`→`resolveCard`),
  end-of-turn `event` cards in hand (`run/engine.ts` `endTurn`→`resolveHandEvents`), and
  interaction resume (`resolveInteraction`). There is **no general event bus**, so a whole
  class of card can't be expressed — anything keyed on a game event whose *timing the card
  doesn't own*. Walls found in a five-card thought experiment:
  - **on-draw** — "building that gives +1💰 each time you draw while staffed." `rules/deck.ts`'s
    `drawCard(G)` is a leaf that just `shift`s into `hand`; no resolver, no tableau access.
  - **on-discard** — "card that resolves when discarded by another card." Every discard is a
    plain array push (`playCard`'s sacrifice loop, `endTurn`'s hand recycle, `discardWorkZone`,
    `rules/effects.ts`'s `demolish`); nothing runs a resolver on the discarded card. Also needs
    to distinguish *discarded-as-a-sacrifice* (should trigger) from *discarded at end of turn*
    (shouldn't).
  - **on-resource-change / on-threshold** — "threat that vanishes once money ≥ 30." A threat
    *can* self-remove today because `tickThreats` resolves it every upkeep — **but only at end
    of round.** An action granting +5💰 mid-turn should retire the threat *the moment money
    crosses 30*, not wait for upkeep. That needs a resource-change (or threshold-crossed)
    event, which doesn't exist. Resource mutations have no choke point: they flow through
    `rules/resources.ts`'s `addResources`/`subtractResources` **and** direct writes in
    `applyEffect` (`G.population`/`territory`/`culture +=`).

  **Design shape (for whoever picks this up):**
  - **Keep "cards own their logic."** A handler is just another resolver closure on the static
    catalogue — e.g. `CardDef.on?: { draw?: Resolver; discard?: Resolver; resourceChange?:
    Resolver }` — run through the existing `EffectContext` (`{ G, self, ... }`) / `resolveCard`
    spine. The bus dispatches; the card computes. No new bespoke branches in moves/upkeep.
  - **Two dispatch flavours:** *self-triggered* (on-discard — run the handler on the instance
    the event is *about*) and *observer* (on-draw / on-resource-change — run the handler on
    every subscribed instance in a zone, e.g. staffed tableau buildings or threats reacting to
    someone else's event). Respect the staffing gate for tableau observers, exactly as
    `resolveZoneProduction` filters on `isOperating`.
  - **Recommended mechanism: post-step diff/reconcile, not mutation-site hooks.** Rather than
    emitting synchronously from inside `addResources`/`drawCard` (which forces every mutation
    through a choke point and invites re-entrancy — a resource-change handler that changes
    resources re-firing itself), run a pure `dispatch(G, event)` at **step boundaries** (after
    a move resolves; after each upkeep sub-step). Snapshot-diff for value events — the exact
    pattern `projectedDelta` already uses (`structuredClone` + compare). The +5💰 example still
    feels immediate: the threat is gone by the time the play finishes resolving, same turn,
    same action — it just fires at move-granularity, not mid-resolver. Everything stays plain
    data on `G` (no `EventEmitter` object), so structuredClone/undo/determinism are untouched.
  - **Open questions to settle:** which zones each event scans (on-draw → staffed tableau only,
    or hand too?); re-entrancy/termination guard (queue events + cap cascade depth, or
    diff-only-at-boundary so within-step changes don't recurse); ordering when several
    subscribers react to one event; and how effects that fire *during a move* surface — they
    needn't be in `projectedDelta` (already happened), but upkeep-time subscribers must be.
  - **Payoff / consumers:** absorbs existing backlog probes — "Card effects that trigger on
    discard / on draw, to enable combos" (*Game design & balance*) and "Card that gives a draw
    when expanding territory" — which become thin `CardDef.on` handlers instead of one-off
    engine edits. Note the self-removal footgun any such handler shares: reassign the zone
    array (`filter`), never `splice`, since `tickThreats`/`resolveZoneProduction` iterate with
    `for...of`. `[size: L]` `[?]` `[phase: 4]`

## Rejected

> Considered and turned down — kept (not deleted) so we don't re-litigate the same idea
> without new information.

- **Ignore worker assignment in the undo list** — assign/unassign worker moves would skip pushing undo snapshots, so undo only steps through "meaningful" turn actions. Tried it (a `quietMove` action updating `present` without touching `past`), then reverted: having worker reassignment silently bundled into the prior card-play's undo step is confusing to the player, while the alternative — reconciling worker state done in the "present" back onto a restored past snapshot — is deeply error-prone (instance-count and population-total edge cases). For now, worker reassignments stay part of the regular undo list; revisit if a cleaner solution presents itself.
- **UI size via `document.documentElement.style.zoom`** — tried a Config-submenu slider applying CSS `zoom` to the document root, on the theory that a root-level zoom would keep everything (including `Board.tsx`'s pointer-drag math) internally consistent, the way real browser zoom does. It doesn't: CSS `zoom` doesn't rescale the viewport that `clientX`/`clientY`/`getBoundingClientRect()` are reported against, so raw pixel values captured from those and written back into inline styles (drag/slotDrag/workerDrag clone positions, the ghost clone, the drop-zone position, the gamearea/gameover-pill insets) get re-zoomed a second time on render. Patched that specific issue with a `px()` real→local conversion helper at each of those six call sites (confirmed fixed at 130% — drag clones tracked the cursor correctly). But testing then surfaced a second, broader problem: run-screen layout broke anyway — building slots sliding under the resource banner, background color bleeding past the bottom hand bar — because `Board.tsx` also leans heavily on `position: fixed` elements, which a root-level zoom interacts with in ways the `px()` patch doesn't cover. Reverted entirely (settings.ts's `uiScale` field, the `App.tsx` zoom effect, `Board.tsx`'s `px()` helper and its six call sites, the GameMenu slider UI). See *UI size setting* above for what a real attempt would need to account for.

## Done / shipped

> Completed items move here (newest first) so the backlog stays current but nothing
> silently vanishes. Everything through **v0.0.2 (end of Phase 2)** has been moved to
> [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); this section restarts empty for Phase 3 onward.

- **Phase 3 Step 7.6 — Card stickers in the run loop** — `state.ts`'s `CardInstance` gained an
  optional `stickers?: string[]`, copied once at mint and never written to during a run.
  `rules/deckBuilder.ts`'s `resolveDeckCards` now returns `DeckCard[]` (`{cardId, stickers?}`, stickers
  copied out of the collection rather than aliased) instead of a bare `string[]`; `RunConfig.deck` is
  `DeckCard[]` accordingly, and `run/setup.ts`'s new `instancesFromDeckCards` (mirroring
  `instancesFromCardIds`) mints each entry's stickers onto its run instance. `rules/stickers.ts` is now
  also the run-side home for interpreting a sticker's actual effect: `effectiveGain` (Reinforced's +1
  per produced resource) and `effectiveCost` (Efficient's −1 per cost resource, floored at 0) are the
  *only* places a sticker id is read and interpreted — `rules/effects.ts`'s `defaultProduce`/
  `specToResolver` compose `effectiveGain` in, and the two cost sites (`playability.ts`'s
  `unplayableReason`, now taking a `self: CardInstance` param, and `moves.ts`'s `playCard`) compose
  `effectiveCost` in — so resolution never reads `self.stickers` ad hoc. A bespoke `resolve`/`produce`
  (Cornucopia, threats) is *not* composed through either function — a deliberate v1 gap, kept
  consistent since such a card's `dynamicText` display doesn't reflect a sticker either.
  `rules/population.ts`'s `addBuilding`/`addWork` gained an optional `stickers` param — without it a
  stickered building/work card would silently lose its bonus the instant it left hand for the
  tableau/workZone, since a fresh instance used to be minted from just `cardId`.
  `rules/stickers.ts`'s new `effectiveCard(card, self)` is the display-side counterpart: a shallow
  `CardDef` copy with `cost`/`produces`/`effect.gain` swapped for their effective values, so every
  `Board.tsx` render site that already did `card={CARDS[cardId]}` swaps in `effectiveCard(...)`
  with no `CardFace` changes at all (hand, tableau `BuildingBox`/`WorkBox`, drag clone, play/discard
  ghosts, the pile viewer, zoom overlay, Foresight's interaction options) — `CardZoomOverlay` gained an
  `overrideCard` prop for this. `groupCards` (the run's pile-viewer grouping) now also singles out a
  stickered instance instead of folding it into a ×N stack, same reasoning as its existing
  `dynamicText` exception. Meta-screen display (Collection/Shop/CardInstancePanel showing effective
  values) and an in-run sticker badge are explicitly **not** part of this step — see Step 7.9.

- **Phase 3 Step 7.5 — Card stickers in the meta (not yet in the run)** — `content/stickers.ts`'s
  `STICKERS` is a small, deliberately inert catalogue (Reinforced/Efficient — name/description/cost
  only, nothing reads them yet; Step 7.6 wires an effect in). `rules/collection.ts`'s
  `MetaCardInstance` gained an optional `stickers?: string[]`, capped at one per instance;
  `rules/stickers.ts`'s `buySticker` spends Influence and mutates one chosen instance in place
  (mirrors `shop.ts`'s `buyTier`), wired via `App.tsx`'s `attachSticker`. A stickered instance
  stops being fungible: `deckBuilder.ts`'s `addCard`/`removeCard` now draw only from
  `unstickeredInstancesOf`, and two new functions, `addInstance`/`removeInstance`, add/remove a
  chosen instance *by identity*. `groupCounts` breaks a stickered instance out of its cardId's ×N
  stack into its own entry; `DeckEditor.tsx`'s picker mirrors this — a card's fungible tile plus one
  addressable tile per owned, not-yet-in-deck stickered instance. `CardFace` gained a `stickerBadge`
  (a bare 🏷️ glyph, no new color token) so a stickered tile reads as distinct everywhere. The
  purchase flow reuses Step 7.3's `CardInstancePanel` via a new `attach` mode (shows each row's
  existing sticker and an "Attach ⭐cost" button) rather than a second picker; `Shop.tsx` opens it
  from a card's new "🏷️ ⭐cost → StickerName" buttons, alongside the existing tier-upgrade button.

- **Phase 3 Step 7.4 — Ordered deck assignment** — `rules/deckBuilder.ts`'s `addCard`/`removeCard`
  now assign *fungible* copies in a deterministic order instead of picking by incidental deck-array
  or collection-iteration position: `addCard` already picked the lowest-index free instance (via
  `instancesOf`'s granted order — unchanged), and `removeCard` now mirrors it, popping the
  *highest*-index in-deck instance rather than the first one found scanning the deck array. Net
  effect: a still-identical card's copies in a deck stay a stable, low-index-first prefix of the
  owned instances as the deck is edited — add, remove, add again returns the same instance rather
  than churning to a different one. This is the ordering Step 7.5's per-instance sticker pick
  (7.3's `CardInstancePanel`) needs to stay meaningful: once copies can differ, this LIFO order is
  only the *default* for the copies still identical to each other.

- **Phase 3 Step 7.3 — Collection per-instance view** — clicking a card tile in `Collection.tsx`
  now opens `meta/CardInstancePanel.tsx` instead of jumping straight to the card zoom: a row per
  owned instance ("Farm 1/2", "Farm 2/2"), each naming the deck(s) it currently sits in (via the
  new `rules/deckBuilder.ts`'s `decksContaining(instanceId, decks)`, filtering decks whose `cards`
  includes that instance id) or "unused" if it's in none. Clicking a row opens the same shared
  `CardZoomOverlay` (every instance looks identical today — no sticker field yet, Step 7.5).
  This is the anti-surprise mechanism Step 7.5 needs: attaching a future sticker becomes an
  *informed* pick of one instance whose deck consequences are already on screen, rather than a
  surprise landing on the wrong copy. `Collection.tsx` now takes a `decks` prop (threaded from
  `MetaMenu.tsx`, which already had it) to resolve usage.
- **Phase 3 Step 7.2 — Uniform meta card instances** — the collection stops being a per-cardId
  count and becomes a set of identified copies: `rules/collection.ts`'s `OwnedCards` is now
  `{ instances: MetaCardInstance[], nextId }` (`MetaCardInstance` just `{ id, cardId }` — no
  sticker field yet, that's Step 7.5), with `nextId` a persistent, append-only allocator distinct
  from the run's `population.ts`'s `nextInstanceId` (that one scans run zones; this one just
  counts up — buying ×2→×4 or a mission unlock appends fresh ids via `grantCopies`, never
  renumbering, so a `DeckDef`'s instance-id references never go stale). `copiesOwned`/`isOwned`
  are now derived by filtering instances. `DeckDef.cards` (`content/decks.ts`) changed meaning
  from cardIds to meta instance ids; `rules/deckBuilder.ts`'s `addCard`/`removeCard` pick *any*
  owned/in-deck instance of a cardId (copies are still fungible — Step 7.4 will pick a stable
  order once stickers make instances worth distinguishing), and `groupCounts`/`resolveDeckCards`
  now take the collection to resolve instance ids back to cardIds for display and for the run
  boundary respectively. Content authoring stays in cardIds: `content/decks.ts`'s `DEFAULT_DECKS`
  is now `DeckSeed[]` (plain cardId lists, since instance identity doesn't exist until a
  collection is actually seeded) and `content/collection.ts`'s `STARTING_COLLECTION` is a plain
  `Record<cardId, count>`; `deckBuilder.ts`'s new `buildSeedDecks` resolves a `DeckSeed[]` into
  real `DeckDef[]` against a freshly-granted collection — the one function `meta/store.ts`'s
  `emptyStore` (and its `parsePlayerStore` decks-fallback) goes through. `contract.ts`'s
  `buildRunConfig` gained a required `collection` param to do that same instance→cardId
  translation when assembling a `RunConfig`; `App.tsx`/`MetaMenu.tsx`/`CampaignMap.tsx`/
  `Decks.tsx`/`DeckDisplay.tsx` all thread `collection` down to wherever a deck's cards are
  displayed or launched. `parsePlayerStore` also gained a shape check on `collection.instances`/
  `nextId` (not just "is an object") so a pre-Step-7.2 save (a bare `{ cardId: count }` map)
  resets to a fresh store instead of crashing deep inside `copiesOwned`. `cloneDecks` is gone —
  `buildSeedDecks` already returns fresh objects, so nothing needed it. No sticker yet; this is
  the identity substrate Steps 7.3–7.6 build on.
- **Phase 3 Step 7.1 — Bounded copy tiers (drop `'unlimited'`)** — copy counts are now ×1/×2/×4/×8,
  no infinite tier — instances are bounded (you can't instantiate infinity), the precondition for
  Step 7.2's uniform meta card instances. `rules/shop.ts`'s `TIER_LADDER`/`nextTier` lost the
  terminal `'unlimited'` rung (the ladder now ends at ×8); `rules/collection.ts`'s `OwnedCards` is
  now a plain `Record<string, number>` (`copiesOwned`/`isOwned` simplified to match), and
  `rules/deckBuilder.ts`'s `addCard` lost its `'unlimited'`-skips-the-cap branch. `CardFace`'s
  `countBadge` prop dropped its `'unlimited'` arm (no more "∞" badge; `Shop.tsx`'s tier-upgrade
  label too). `content/collection.ts`'s `STARTING_COLLECTION` reseeded the three basics that were
  `'unlimited'` (settlers/corvee/harvest) to `2` each — matching every other starting card's "just
  enough for the starting deck" count, since the starting deck only ever needs 2 of each. Pre-alpha:
  no migration.
- **Phase 3 Step 6.3c — Creeping Decay infinite mission** — the first *real* infinite mission,
  and the first *escalating* threat. **Creeping Decay** (`content/cards.ts`, a `threat` card) owns
  its drain via a bespoke `resolve` — reads its own `getCounter(self, 'level')`, scales a base
  −1🔨 by `level + 1`, applies it via `scaleResources`/`subtractResources`, then bumps its own
  counter — mirroring Cornucopia's per-play growth resolver (Step 6.1), just tick-triggered instead
  of play-triggered. **The Long Decline** (`content/missions.ts`, `kind: 'infinite'`) seeds it once
  via `addThreat` in `setup`; its `objective`/`failure` are both `() => false` — an infinite mission
  never wins or fails on its own, so the escalating drain forcing Production negative and tripping
  the universal `coreCollapse` → `'ruin'` (`run/engine.ts`) is its *only* ending, at which point
  `computeRewards`' existing infinite branch pays Influence = rounds survived. No gameover-overlay
  or campaign-map changes were needed — the generic `'infinite'`-kind plumbing (gameover reward
  line, the campaign map's bottom banner, `MissionDetailPanel`, `applyRunResult`) already built in
  Step 6.2 renders/handles a real infinite mission with zero further changes, confirmed both by a
  `run/run.test.ts` integration test (a Farm keeps Food flat so Production, not famine, is what
  collapses first — proving the threat, not an unrelated resource floor, ends the run) and an
  in-browser click-through of the full mission → threat-zone → zoom → end-run path.
- **Phase 3 Step 6.3b — Threat UI + Long Winter's food drain as a real threat card** — `G.threats`
  now renders on the board: `Board.tsx`'s new `ThreatZone` is a real, in-flow **left column** of
  `.gamearea` (`.threatColumn`, its own `overflow-y: auto`), not a floating overlay — a first pass
  stacked it under the fixed-position `MissionWidget`, but that doesn't reserve layout space, so
  it crept in front of the slot grid's first row once taller than one card; `.gamearea` is now a
  row (`.threatColumn` beside a new `.gameContent` wrapping the slot grid + work strip) so the
  tableau reflows beside the threat column instead of sitting under it. Each threat is a real
  `CardFace` reading only `GameState`, never the mission — reuses `card.dynamicText?.(G, self)` (the
  same hook Cornucopia's growing gain already threads through every render site) for a growing
  threat's live drain, falling back to the static `description` for a flat one; click opens the
  shared `CardZoomOverlay`. Threats get their own `CardKind`, `'threat'`, rather than reusing
  `'event'`: `CardFace`'s `describeConditions` hard-codes event-only text ("resolves at end of
  round") that would misdescribe a persistent, tick-every-upkeep hazard. `'threat'` reuses `'event'`'s
  already-CVD-vetted red identity (`kindClass`) — just a different banner label — and is excluded
  everywhere `'event'` already is (`Collection.tsx`/`DeckEditor.tsx`/`Shop.tsx`'s picker filters,
  `deckBuilder.addCard`'s reject-on-add). The Long Winter mission's `onUpkeep` hand-drain of 2 Food
  is gone, replaced by a real card — **Harsh Winter** (`content/cards.ts`, a flat non-escalating
  `effect.loss: { food: 2 }`, no bespoke `resolve` needed) — seeded once via `addThreat` in the
  mission's (now-added) `setup`.
- **Phase 3 Step 6.3a — Threat zone (pure core)** — `GameState` gained `threats: ThreatInstance[]`
  (`rules/state.ts` — `ThreatInstance` is just a `CardInstance`, empty in `blankState`;
  mission-seeded only, so a no-op field on every run that doesn't use one) and a new
  `rules/threats.ts`: `addThreat(G, cardId)` seeds one bare (no counters yet). Escalation is
  **the card's responsibility, not the engine's** — an earlier draft had `tickThreats` read and
  scale `CARDS[cardId].effect.loss` itself, which was caught in review as bypassing the resolver
  spine (`effects.ts`'s `resolveCard`, "the single path 'the card's effect' runs through").
  Corrected: `tickThreats(G)` just calls `resolveCard({ G, self: t })` per threat — the threat
  card's own `resolve` computes and applies its drain and bumps its own counter, mirroring
  Cornucopia's per-play growth (Step 6.1) but tick-triggered instead of play-triggered, so a
  future Creeping Decay never touches the declarative `effect` bag at all (same as Cornucopia
  doesn't). `rules/population.ts`'s `nextInstanceId` now also scans `G.threats`, since it shares
  the run-wide instance-id space. `tickThreats` is called unconditionally from `upkeep.ts`'s
  `applyUpkeep` (a no-op when `threats` is empty), so it flows into `projectedDelta`'s UI preview
  for free with no risk of drift between preview and actual — confirmed by an `applyUpkeep`-level
  test alongside `rules/threats.test.ts`'s direct coverage (a flat-loss card ticking unscaled, a
  counter-scaling resolver escalating across ticks, no-threats no-op). No UI, no real
  threat-seeding mission yet — that's Step 6.3b's board UI and Step 6.3c's Creeping Decay.
- **Phase 3 Step 6.2 — Infinite-mission plumbing + campaign UI + scoring** — `MissionDef`'s
  `reward` and `map` are now optional (`'infinite'` missions have neither). `rules/rewards.ts`'s
  `computeRewards` gains an infinite branch — Influence = rounds survived
  (`RunResult.stats.turnsTaken`), paid regardless of `alreadyCompleted` or unlock, no collection
  change. The actual store fold was pulled out of `App.tsx`'s `recordResult` into a new pure,
  unit-tested `meta/store.ts`'s `applyRunResult(store, result, mission)`: a `'standard'` mission
  marks `mapProgress` and pays its reward only on a victory outcome, same as before; an
  `'infinite'` mission never touches `mapProgress` and pays on *every* attempt, win or lose —
  `recordResult` is now a one-line `persist(applyRunResult(...))`. The direct
  `mission.reward.unlockCardId` reads in the gameover overlay (`Board.tsx`) and
  `MissionDetailPanel` (`CampaignMap.tsx`) are now guarded, and both render an infinite-specific
  line ("Influence = rounds survived" / "No unlock — paid every attempt") instead of a card face.
  `CampaignMap.tsx` splits missions by `kind`: `'infinite'` ones are filtered out of the
  DAG/timeline and into a new always-visible bottom banner (`.infiniteBanner`, a `flex: 0 0 auto`
  sibling of `.canvas`, never `position: fixed` — matches the map's existing viewport-fixed
  workaround) reusing the already-CVD-vetted `--map-node-available` tokens plus a glyph + text
  label (no color-only state). Verified end-to-end in-browser with a throwaway `toto` mission
  (`kind: 'infinite'`, objective `round > 10`, no failure of its own) — banner placement, detail
  panel, launch, ~equal-to-round-count Influence paid on both a victory-outcome stop and a
  famine-defeat-outcome stop, and the mission staying un-cleared after either — then removed
  once confirmed, since it's a harness, not real content. `rules/rewards.test.ts` and
  `meta/store.test.ts` cover the infinite branch directly (no real infinite mission exists yet to
  exercise via `run/run.test.ts` — that's Step 6.3c's Creeping Decay).
- **Dynamic cards show their live value everywhere in the run, split into two bands** —
  `CardDef` gains `dynamicRule?: string`, a static line describing *how* a dynamic card's effect
  scales (e.g. Cornucopia's "+1 each time played"), rendered in the existing conditions
  band (`CardFace.tsx`'s `describeConditions`) alongside discard cost / culture-level gates — in
  every context, live instance or not, since the rule text itself never changes. `dynamicText`
  keeps its old job — the bottom-most text band's actual *current* number — but is now threaded
  through every run render site, not just the hand: the discard-cost and destroy-targeting ghost
  flights (`spawnGhost`/`ghostFromSlot` gained an `overrideText` param, computed from
  `G.hand[handIdx]` before the play resolves, so the flying clone matches what the hand card just
  showed), the drag clone, the zoom overlay (`Board.tsx`'s `zoom` state became `{ cardId,
  overrideText } | null`; `CardZoomOverlay` gained an `overrideText` prop, unused by its two
  static callers), and the discard/removed pile viewers. The pile viewers needed a real rework,
  not just threading: `pileView` now carries `CardInstance[]` (not `cardId[]`), and `groupCards`
  no longer coalesces a dynamic card's copies into one shared-count tile (two Cornucopia with
  different play counts can't share one number) — a card with `dynamicText` always renders as its
  own single-count entry, keyed by its stable instance id. Foresight's peek modal is covered too —
  `pendingInteraction.options` were already full `CardInstance`s, just missing the `overrideText`
  wiring, so a revealed Cornucopia now shows its real current gain instead of the base "+1🌾".
- **Card-effect resolver + interaction rewrite** (plan: `.claude/plans/we-are-doing-code-wondrous-hoare.md`)
  — replaced the flat `CardEffect` data-bag + growing `applyEffect` switch with a **resolver spine**:
  every card resolves through one path, `resolveCard(ctx)`, picking its own `CardDef.resolve` closure
  or the declarative default `specToResolver(effect)`; the `EffectContext` (`{ G, self, target?,
  answer? }`) is the seam that lets an effect know which card is resolving and what it targets. Shipped
  in four green stages (one commit each):
  - **Stage 1** — resolver spine, behavior-preserving; `destroy`/`remove` folded in from `playCard`.
  - **Stage 2** — Cornucopia (first dynamic-effect card) + `scaleResources` primitive.
  - **Stage 3** — interaction layer: plain-data `pendingInteraction` on `G`, a two-branch re-entrant
    resolver + `resolveInteraction` move, resolve-only modal; Foresight (first interactive card).
  - **Stage 4** — **per-copy identity**: card zones (`hand`/`deck`/`discard`/`removed`) went from
    `string[]` to `CardInstance[]` (`{ id, cardId, counters? }`), `PlacedCard` extends `CardInstance`,
    and `nextInstanceId` now scans every zone so ids are unique run-wide. Per-instance run state lives
    in each copy's own `counters` (via `getCounter`/`bumpCounter`), replacing the interim central
    `GameState.cardState` bag; Cornucopia's growth is now genuinely per-copy (playing one never buffs
    another). `instancesFromCardIds` is the shared mint path (setup, mission-injected cards, tests).
- **Phase 3 Step 6.1 — Non-fixed (dynamic) card effects** — delivered across Stages 2 and 4 of the
  resolver rewrite just above: `scaleResources` (`rules/resources.ts`) is the reusable "scale an
  effect by a counter" primitive (Step 6.3's threat drain reuses it), and Stage 4's per-instance
  `counters` gave every card copy its own run-scoped number — **reversing the earlier "add a typed
  field, no generic bag" guidance**: card-specific numbers belong on the card instance, not
  accreted onto `GameState` as named fields. First card shipped: **Cornucopia** (`content/cards.ts`)
  — a `resolve`-driven `action` gaining `+1🌾` plus `+1` per prior play *of that same copy* this run
  (playing one copy never buffs another); its growing value surfaces via a card-owned
  `dynamicText(G, self)` hook (see "Dynamic cards show their live value everywhere" below for the
  full render-site list).
- **Mystery card reuses `CardFace`** — `CampaignMap.tsx`'s hand-rolled `MysteryCard` (a
  one-off grey box borrowing only `CardFace.module.css`'s outer `.card` class) is gone;
  `CardFace` now takes a `faceDown` prop (a discriminated union with `card`, so `card` is
  only required when not face-down) rendering the same 118×162 box and header/banner/
  description band layout as a real face — all blank grey, no text — plus a "?" glyph in the
  art slot, instead of real card content. `MissionDetailPanel` calls `<CardFace faceDown />`
  for the pre-clear reward slot.
- **Bug fix: corner count-badge clipped in card grids** — root cause was a `box-sizing`
  mismatch, not the badge position: `CardFace.module.css`'s `.card` never set `box-sizing`,
  so a `<div>` instance (Collection/Shop) inherited the default `content-box` and rendered
  136×179 — 18px wider than its `118px` grid track — while an `as="button"` instance (hand,
  deck-editor picker) got the UA `border-box` and fit at 118×162. The oversized divs
  overlapped their right-hand neighbour, which painted over the `top:-8px; right:-8px`
  badge. Fixed with one line — `box-sizing: border-box` on `.card` — so every `CardFace`
  renders an identical 118×162 box regardless of `as`; tiles now sit inside their tracks
  and the badge protrudes cleanly into the grid gap. Verified in-browser across the
  Collection, Shop, and deck-editor grids (0 clipped badges each).
- **Phase 3 Step 1 — Ownership & currency core** — `rules/collection.ts` (`OwnedCards`,
  `copiesOwned`, `isOwned`); `content/collection.ts`'s narrow `STARTING_COLLECTION`;
  `content/decks.ts` trimmed to a single starting deck (`starter`/"Founding Deck"), built
  entirely from what `STARTING_COLLECTION` owns; `PlayerStore` gains `influence` /
  `collection` / `mapProgress` (all required — no migration path for a pre-alpha save
  missing them).
- **Phase 3 Step 2 — Deck-editor copy caps** — visibility half: `Collection` and
  `DeckEditor`'s picker omit not-yet-unlocked cards entirely (not shown locked), no total
  count hint. Cap half: `deckBuilder.addCard` rejects an add past the copies owned
  (`'unlimited'` never caps); `DeckEditor`'s picker tile dims/disables once every owned
  copy is already in the deck (click and drag both no-op) instead of silently rejecting;
  its count badge shows *remaining* copies left to add, not total owned (`CardFace` gained
  an `alwaysShowBadge` prop so this badge can surface even at ×1/×0, unlike every other
  `countBadge` use, which stays hidden at 1 since those show a stack count instead).
- **Phase 3 Step 3 — Mission model + campaign-map data** — `MissionDef` gains `prereqs`
  (mission ids required first, empty = DAG root) and `kind: 'standard' | 'infinite'`;
  `rules/campaign.ts` (`isCompleted`/`isAvailable`/`availableMissions`) + tests, including a
  pinned "completed stays available" replay case. Test DAG reuses the 3 existing missions:
  The Long Winter is the root, The Enlightenment and Barbarian Tide both gate on it.
  `MissionSelect` hides not-yet-unlocked missions entirely; `App.recordResult` marks
  `mapProgress` on victory, so the unlock chain is live end-to-end (Influence/unlock reward
  computation itself stays Step 4). `reward`/map-position fields deferred — no consumer yet,
  shape isn't settled by the design doc.
- **Phase 3 Step 4 — Reward computation + run-end wiring** — `MissionDef` gains a required
  `reward: { influence, unlockCardId }` (Long Winter 1⭐/Granary, Enlightenment 2⭐/University,
  Barbarian Tide 2⭐/Conquest); `rules/rewards.ts`'s `computeRewards` is the one pure function
  that decides the payout — a no-op replay if the mission was *already* completed (checked
  against `mapProgress` from *before* this result, so back-to-back wins of the same mission
  can't double-grant), and a no-op unlock if the card is somehow already owned. `App.recordResult`
  applies it to `store.influence`/`store.collection` alongside the existing `mapProgress` write.
  The gameover overlay (`Board.tsx`) previews the same payout off the same pure function and
  the pre-run `mapProgress`/`collection` App passes down — a preview, not a second source of
  truth — showing "+N ⭐ Influence · Unlocked X" on a first clear or "Already cleared — no
  reward for a replay." otherwise. A coherence test pins every mission's `unlockCardId`
  resolving to a real `content/cards.ts` id. `RunResult.score`/infinite-mission payout stays
  deferred to **Step 6**, since there's no infinite mission yet to produce a score; `Stats`
  surfacing a per-run reward is also deferred — `RunResult` deliberately excludes rewards
  (see `contract.ts`), and there's no per-run record of whether *that* run was a first clear
  (`mapProgress` is current state, not a history snapshot).
- **Influence nav display** (pulled forward from Step 5) — `MetaMenu`'s left nav shows a
  `⭐ <count>` pill between the game title and the screen buttons, reading `store.influence`.
- **Phase 3 Step 5.1 — Campaign Map screen** — `CampaignMap.tsx` replaces the flat
  `MissionSelect` with humanity's history as a horizontally-scrollable branching tech tree
  (drag-to-pan reusing the Board/DeckEditor pointer convention). `MissionDef` gains an authored
  `map: { col, row }` grid position; nodes are placed from it, edges drawn from `prereqs`, and
  per-node state comes from `rules/campaign.ts` (cleared ✓ / available ▶ / locked). Locked
  nodes are **silhouettes** — position + lock glyph shown to orient the player in history, but
  name/objective/reward hidden and the node inert (a deliberate divergence from the earlier
  hide-everything precedent). A single "Testing" age band (`content/ages.ts`, a right-arrow
  shape) spans the top; the age→column-range mapping for multiple ages is deferred (only one
  age to place). Clicking a cleared/available node opens a launch popup (board picker left,
  deck picker right, nothing pre-selected, "Start Mission" disabled until both chosen); the
  reward preview shows the Influence amount and that a card unlocks but not which. The deck
  picker's tile-fan + list-view display is extracted into shared `components/DeckDisplay.tsx`
  (`DeckTile`/`DeckListOverlay`, also now used by `Decks.tsx`) minus the edit/copy/delete
  buttons — clicking an unselected deck selects it, clicking the selected one opens its
  list-view. New map/age/node theme tokens in `index.css` (Light + Dark; CVD themes fall
  through to Light since node state carries glyph + text-label backups, not color alone).
- **Phase 3 Step 5.2 — Shop** — `rules/shop.ts` is the one pure place the copy-tier economy
  lives: `TIER_LADDER` (×1→×2→×4→unlimited at 1/2/5 Influence — numbers balance-tunable, the
  ladder a core rule like `MAX_DECKS`), `nextTier` (next rung + cost, or null for a
  maxed/not-owned/off-ladder count — one predicate meaning "owned *and* still upgradeable"), and
  `buyTier` (the immutable `{ influence, collection }` purchase, returning null for an
  unaffordable/maxed/not-owned card, mirroring `computeRewards`). `meta/Shop.tsx` (the new `🛒
  Shop` nav tab) lists only upgradeable owned cards (the `nextTier !== null` filter hides both
  the ∞ basics and anything not unlocked), grouped like `Collection.tsx`, each tile a `CardFace`
  (current tier badge) over a one-click buy button (`⭐cost → ×N`, disabled when unaffordable —
  no confirm, since a purchase only ever adds copies). `App.tsx`'s `buyCardTier` runs `buyTier`
  and `persist`s the reduced Influence + bumped collection, so the nav ⭐ pill and the list
  update live (a card bought to unlimited drops out). Stickers stay Step 7 (need per-copy
  identity first). `rules/shop.test.ts` covers the ladder + purchase edge cases.
- **Phase 3 Step 5.3 — Mission detail panel** — `MissionDef` gains a `lore` field (narrative
  flavour text, distinct from the existing mechanical `description`). Clicking a cleared/
  available map node now opens `MissionDetailPanel` first: left column is lore + description +
  victory/failure hints, right column is the reward — an Influence line (struck through once
  already cleared) with a subtitle ("1 new card" / "Cards already unlocked"), and either a
  grey face-down `MysteryCard` (pre-clear) or the real unlocked `CardFace` (post-clear) below
  it. Its "Continue" hands off to the existing `LaunchPopup` (board/deck picker), which no
  longer repeats lore/reward text in its own header now that Step 5.3 owns that.
