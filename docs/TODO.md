# CivCardGame — TODO / Planner

> A **rudimentary, temporary planner** — a lightweight ticket manager and
> scratchpad, *not* a durable record. Items are planned here, executed one by one,
> and brainstormed/refined in place. Content is grouped by codebase area, with a
> *Done / shipped* archive at the bottom.
>
> **This content is designed to be discarded:** at each version bump the shipped
> items are erased and replaced by short one-line [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)
> entries. So TODO.md holds *transient* planning state; [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)
> holds the *decided design*, and `CHANGELOG.md` the *durable history*. Nothing
> durable should reference an item here — the citation would rot when this is wiped.

**How we use it:** say *"jot: …"* or *"TODO: …"* (or "note that down") mid-task and
the idea lands here as a one-liner without derailing what we're doing. We triage
later — promote items into `DESIGN.md` / real work, or drop them.

> Tags (optional): `[size: S/M/L]` rough effort · `[?]` needs design discussion ·
> `[blocked]` waiting on something else · `[phase: N]` roadmap phase (1 = run loop · 2 = contract + meta shell · 3 = economy & progression · 4 = content & balance).

## Phase 4 — planned steps (content & balance)

> Phase 4 is content expansion + balance tuning with the headless simulator (see
> [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) *Build roadmap*). It kicks off with tutorial onboarding, since new
> content is what a new player meets first.

- **Step 1 — Tutorial missions** — the first few meta missions double as tutorials,
  introducing mechanics progressively; tutorial entry-node missions on the map. Covers
  designing several missions, onboarding indicators/popups, and careful pacing so new
  mechanics aren't dumped on the player all at once. Rough pacing: the starting deck holds
  only `work`/`action` cards, no buildings — mission 1 unlocks the first buildings (House,
  Farm, Workshop); mission 2 introduces territory limitation (and maybe conquest?) alongside
  them. Goal is to reach a certain population. Unlocks culture stuff. Mission 3 explains culture, goal to reach culture lvl2. `[size: L]` `[?]` `[phase: 4]`

- **Step 2 — Headless simulator (balance tooling)** — a code-driven, no-browser/no-React
  runner over the pure core, for statistical balance answers no human can play enough games
  to reach (is a mission winnable? is a sticker overpowered? is a card ever played? is the
  food economy too tight?). Feasible because the core is already framework-free, deterministic
  (seeded RNG), and — post the "cards/stickers own their logic" + event-bus refactors — holds
  *all* real game behaviour behind `resolveCard`/`StickerDef` hooks/the always-drained bus, so a
  sim consumes the genuine behaviour with no duplicated branch; the bus's fixed dispatch order +
  `MAX_EVENT_CASCADE` cap guarantee determinism and termination even under a fuzzing policy. Only
  new consideration is throughput (millions of `endTurn`s), not viability. **First deliverable:** a
  tiny `simulateRun(config, policy)` helper beside `run/engine.ts` + a **random-legal-move policy**
  (doubles as a crash/illegal-state fuzzer), before any smarter policy or result aggregation.
  Later: heuristic policies, batch runs across seeds/decks/missions, aggregation/reporting.
  `[size: M]` `[?]` `[phase: 4]`

## Cards & content (`src/content/`)

- **Remove Settlers, replace with a Hut building** `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Disasters — expand** — the `event` card mechanic shipped (see `CHANGELOG.md`); grow it out with more disaster types beyond the Barbarian and missions that inject them (details TBD) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- New mission type: "Metropolis" `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- New mission: "Build the Wonder" `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Culture-based missions (depend on the Culture resource) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Building that changes hand size (e.g. +1 card drawn per round) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Resources transformation? Like a building that transforms production into science for example `[phase: 4]`
- **Age tag on cards** — tag each card with the age it unlocks in, so the player can sort/filter by age `[?]` `[phase: 4]`

## UI (`src/components/`)

- **Multi-pip staffing UI** — once a building can require 2–3 workers, its box needs one pip per worker slot (not the current single staff-toggle icon), so partial staffing is visible and each pip can be dragged independently. Follow-up to the now-shipped building→building worker drag; blocked on a multi-worker building actually existing (see [[multi-worker-buildings-roadmap]]). `[size: M] [?] [blocked]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Bulk-move modifier for worker transfers** — a modifier (e.g. shift-drag) to move N workers from one building to another in one gesture, instead of one pip-drag per worker. Only pays off once multi-pip staffing (above) exists. `[size: S] [?] [blocked]` `[phase: 4]`
- **BoardMini: color starting numbers vs. a baseline** — on the board widget, tint each starting counter relative to a baseline (probably the average of all boards): above baseline → green with an up-arrow, below → red with a down-arrow; a 0 against a 0 baseline greys out/ghosts. Makes a board's strengths/weaknesses legible at a glance. `[?]`

## Game design & balance

- Card that gives a draw when expanding territory `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Card effects that trigger on discard / on draw, to enable combos `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Minimum deck size — 20 cards** — enforce a floor on deck size (mirrors the existing
  `MAX_DECKS` cap precedent — a core rule enforced at the deck writer, not just a UI gate);
  also means adjusting `content/decks.ts`'s starter deck up to 20 cards to satisfy it.
  `[phase: 4]`
- **Default hand limit — 4 instead of 5** — lower the base starting hand size from 5 to 4.
