# CivCardGame — TODO / Idea Backlog

> A scratch list for ideas caught **in passing** so they aren't lost — *not* a
> committed plan. Anything here is a candidate, not a promise. Decided, designed
> work lives in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md); this is the inbox that feeds it.

**How we use it:** say *"jot: …"* or *"TODO: …"* (or "note that down") mid-task and
the idea lands here as a one-liner without derailing what we're doing. We triage
later — promote items into `DESIGN.md` / real work, or drop them.

> Tags (optional): `[size: S/M/L]` rough effort · `[?]` needs design discussion ·
> `[blocked]` waiting on something else · `[phase: N]` roadmap phase (1 = run loop · 2 = contract + meta shell · 3 = economy & progression · 4 = content & balance).

## Meta loop (`src/meta/`)

- **Tutorial missions** — the first few meta missions double as tutorials, introducing mechanics progressively `[?]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Card modifiers** — meta may offer ways to attach persistent modifiers to individual cards (long-term idea, details TBD) `[?]` `[phase: 3]`
- **Stats screen UI rework** — `Stats.tsx` is currently a plain list of run-result rows (shell-only, shipped with Phase 2 step 6); revisit its look once there's more to show (rewards, trends across runs) `[?]` `[phase: 3]`

## Cards & content (`src/content/`)

- **Disasters — expand** — the `event` card mechanic shipped (see `CHANGELOG.md`); grow it out with more disaster types beyond the Barbarian and missions that inject them (details TBD) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- New mission type: "Metropolis" `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- New mission: "Build the Wonder" `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Culture-based missions (depend on the Culture resource) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Building that changes hand size (e.g. +1 card drawn per round) `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Culture thresholds change hand size by default (no building required) — culture as a passive progression axis `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Resources transformation? Like a building that transforms production into science for example `[phase: 4]`

## UI (`src/components/`)

- **Multi-pip staffing UI** — once a building can require 2–3 workers, its box needs one pip per worker slot (not the current single staff-toggle icon), so partial staffing is visible and each pip can be dragged independently. Follow-up to the now-shipped building→building worker drag; blocked on a multi-worker building actually existing (see [[multi-worker-buildings-roadmap]]). `[size: M] [?] [blocked]` `[phase: 4]`
- **Bulk-move modifier for worker transfers** — a modifier (e.g. shift-drag) to move N workers from one building to another in one gesture, instead of one pip-drag per worker. Only pays off once multi-pip staffing (above) exists. `[size: S] [?] [blocked]` `[phase: 4]`

## Game design & balance

- Card that gives a draw when expanding territory `[?]` `[phase: 4]`
- Card effects that trigger on discard / on draw, to enable combos `[?]` `[phase: 4]`

## Rejected

> Considered and turned down — kept (not deleted) so we don't re-litigate the same idea
> without new information.

- **Ignore worker assignment in the undo list** — assign/unassign worker moves would skip pushing undo snapshots, so undo only steps through "meaningful" turn actions. Tried it (a `quietMove` action updating `present` without touching `past`), then reverted: having worker reassignment silently bundled into the prior card-play's undo step is confusing to the player, while the alternative — reconciling worker state done in the "present" back onto a restored past snapshot — is deeply error-prone (instance-count and population-total edge cases). For now, worker reassignments stay part of the regular undo list; revisit if a cleaner solution presents itself.
- **UI size via `document.documentElement.style.zoom`** — tried a Config-submenu slider applying CSS `zoom` to the document root, on the theory that a root-level zoom would keep everything (including `Board.tsx`'s pointer-drag math) internally consistent, the way real browser zoom does. It doesn't: CSS `zoom` doesn't rescale the viewport that `clientX`/`clientY`/`getBoundingClientRect()` are reported against, so raw pixel values captured from those and written back into inline styles (drag/slotDrag/workerDrag clone positions, the ghost clone, the drop-zone position, the gamearea/gameover-pill insets) get re-zoomed a second time on render. Patched that specific issue with a `px()` real→local conversion helper at each of those six call sites (confirmed fixed at 130% — drag clones tracked the cursor correctly). But testing then surfaced a second, broader problem: run-screen layout broke anyway — building slots sliding under the resource banner, background color bleeding past the bottom hand bar — because `Board.tsx` also leans heavily on `position: fixed` elements, which a root-level zoom interacts with in ways the `px()` patch doesn't cover. Reverted entirely (settings.ts's `uiScale` field, the `App.tsx` zoom effect, `Board.tsx`'s `px()` helper and its six call sites, the GameMenu slider UI). See *UI size setting* above for what a real attempt would need to account for.

## Done / shipped

> Completed items move here (newest first) so the backlog stays current but nothing
> silently vanishes. Everything through **v0.0.2 (end of Phase 2)** has been moved to
> [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); this section restarts empty for Phase 3 onward.
